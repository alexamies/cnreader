始計第一
Section I: Laying Plans

孫子曰：兵者，國之大事，
[p. 1] Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State. 

死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也。
It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. 

故經之以五事，校之以計，而索其情：
The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. 

一曰道，二曰天，三曰地，四曰将，五曰法。
[p. 2] These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline. 

道者，令民與上同意，可與之死，可與之生，而不畏危也。
The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger. 

天者，陰陽、寒暑、時制也。
Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons. 

地者，高下、遠近、險易、廣狹、死生也。
Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death. 

將者，智、信、仁、勇、嚴也。
[p. 3] The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness. 

法者，曲制、官道、主用也。
By Method and discipline are to be understood the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure. 

凡此五者，將莫不聞，知之者勝，不知者不勝。
These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail. 

故校之以計而索其情，
Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:— 

曰：主孰有道？將孰有能？天地孰得？法令孰行？兵眾孰強？士卒孰練？賞罰孰明？
[p. 4] Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? 
Which of the two generals has most ability? 
With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? 
On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? 
Which army is stronger? 
On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?
